To download the game, go into the "builds" folder, and pick from windows, linux or mac depending on your OS.

For linux and mac, you might need to manually allow the system to run the file, as I'm not recognizerd as an official developer, so it wont let it open ToT

Fow windows, the windows smartscreen popup is going to appear, so just click "more info" and then "run anyways"
